* Quote:

I’d encourage you to think about this a different way using something I call the D-to-C Framework: from derision to curiosity.

Why would someone want this fabric? Why would someone spend $10,000+ for a jacket made from this? (Hint: It’s not just to show off. Most people can’t even recognize what this is!)

Why do some people fly business class?

Why do some people hire a nanny?

The answer is that we all value different things. If you love something -- and you can afford it -- get it! My goal is to expose you to different ways of thinking so you can decide what your Rich Life means to you.

“Tell me about yourself,” 
a.k.a the only icebreaker 
you’ll ever need

Here’s the thing: When I stopped instantly reacting to everyone else’s priorities, I got better at making time for the projects I believed were most important - even if they weren’t urgent or nobody was asking for them.

Gratitude. 

My fault by default. 

### Trening

Five to ten squats. Squats involve keeping both feet flat on the floor while lowering yourself down. Keep your back straight.

Five to ten calf raises. Stand up straight and slowly lift your heels, pushing yourself up on tiptoe.

Five to ten press-ups. Lie face down on the floor with both hands shoulder-width apart. Brace yourself on hands and feet. Lower your chest toward the floor and then push yourself back up.

Five to ten tricep dips. Stand with your back to a table or chair, and put your palms on the edge of the surface. Then, lower and raise your body by bending at the elbow.

Finally, try five to ten lunges. Begin standing upright, then put one foot in front of the other leg and bend both knees. Keep your torso straight, and lower your body. Then lift yourself up again.

7 Rules for Eating
https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20090323/7-rules-for-eating#1


### Relaxation Response

1.   Sit quietly in a comfortable position.


2.  Close your eyes.


3. Deeply relax all your muscles, 
beginning at your feet and progressing up to your face. 
Keep them relaxed.


4.  Breathe through your nose. 
Become aware of your breathing. 
As you breathe out, say the word, "one"*, 
silently to yourself. For example, 
breathe in ... out, "one",- in .. out, "one", etc. 
Breathe easily and naturally.


5.  Continue for 10 to 20 minutes. 
You may open your eyes to check the time, but do not use an alarm. 
When you finish, sit quietly for several minutes, 
at first with your eyes closed and later with your eyes opened. 
Do not stand up for a few minutes.


6.  Do not worry about whether you are successful 
in achieving a deep level of relaxation. 
Maintain a passive attitude and permit relaxation to occur at its own pace. 
When distracting thoughts occur, 
try to ignore them by not dwelling upon them 
and return to repeating "one."


With practice, the response should come with little effort. 
Practice the technique once or twice daily, 
but not within two hours after any meal, 
since the digestive processes seem to interfere with 
the elicitation of the Relaxation Response.


It is better to use a soothing, mellifluous sound, preferably with no meaning.
or association, to avoid stimulation of unnecessary thoughts - a mantra.*

### Trees

That when you go out into the woods and you look at trees, you see all these different trees. And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. And you look at the tree and you allow it. You appreciate it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don’t get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree.

The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying “You’re too this, or I’m too this.” That judging mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.
